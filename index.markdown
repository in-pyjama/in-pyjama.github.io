Embedded Systems guide, for the engineer, by the engineer!

We are a bunch of embedded systems engineers trying to give back to the community by publishing and organizing content on various topics that an embedded engineer or an aspiring engineer might be interested in.
This repository contains the landing page for the in-pyjama github site

We curate content on Embedded Systems to help our readers (beginners or professionals) become better engineers and grow as a professional (anxiety free). Topics include -

C, C++, Assembly Language, Rust, and Python.
ARM (A/M Class) and RISC-V CPU Architecture.
Operating Systems (Linux/RTOS/Baremetal).
Digital Hardware Design and FPGAs.
Command line Tools and Utilities.
Career and Productivity tips, Lectures, Notes, Courses, Blogs, and interesting links.
